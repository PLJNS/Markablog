Design and Manifest of PLJNS.com
--------------------------------

Hello, world!

Clean, concentrated, and light content creation and consumption are my principle goals.
There is a lot I want to share with the world, and I am building the platform I want to do that on.
What I read for philosophy, the hacks I discover while programming, what I learn about living well ...

Each post will simply be a Markdown file.
The style of this site should refined, readable, and weightless - almost unnoticeable.
Thank you for taking an interest! I cannot wait to share what I learn with you.
